 Intro to dream sequence
	Humanity's first two inventions, the wheel and the club...
	Cowboys taming wild horses, while holding their muskets, ready to hit...

	Since the dawn of humanity, hitting and riding has been the fundamental basis of humanity.
	And it all climaxes today, in the battle for the Bosoking throne as the 5th generation head of all M City delinquents (legally binding with tax benefits)!!
	Our first contestants are the legendary 4th generation head Julian and his team, the Trips! Fables and tv dramas have been writing about their adventures! Plus a feature film with Tom Cruise is in the works!
	The challengers are an up-and-coming team full of sexy womanizers with deftly toned bodies, it's the Ütz and their fearless leader Joooooo!
	Jo: Haha, I'm not just sexy, I am a rocket scientist too, don't forget that! E=MC^2 to all you girls at home!
	Who will take the crone tonight! Let the battle begin!
		Dream fight
	THEY WON! THEY WON! ÜTZ WON AGAINST THE 4TH GENERATION HEAD MAKING THEM THE NEW TOP DELINQUENTS OF M CITY! THE PERSON READING THIS MUST BE BREAKING OUT IN TEARS TOO, AFTER ALL THE BUILDUP THIS ILLUSTRIOUS TITLE HAS RECEIVED!
	AS IS TRADITION, THEY WILL NOW LEAD "THE GREAT PROCESSION" DOWN MAIN STREET, WITH ALL OTHER DELINQUENTS FOLLOWING THEM BEHIND ON THEIR BIKES!
	Jo: It was nothing much, for a rocket scientist such as myself.
	Random delinquents: Please make us your underlings, 5th generation head!
	Random girls: Please let us have your children, 5th generation head!
	Random bank clerk delinquents: Please take all our money as a token of appreciation, 5th generation head!
	Random delinquents with Ütz in foreground: Jo! Jo! Jo! Jo! Jo! Jo!
	
	[BG School, Jo left, Dave right, Woz center]
	Back to reality:
	Jo: So that's how it would basically go down, more or less. What do you think?
	David: ...
	Woz: ...
	David: He's an idiot, right?
	Woz: He's an idiot.
	
	TO BE CONTINUED
	
	Jo: I can hear you, you know.
	David: Look, this is like the fifth get-popular-quick scheme you fell for this week alone! With goldfish training I could at least see the point, but delinquency?
	Woz: I'd bet a million dollars that you won't get us to join yo-
	Jo: You can get mad pussy from all the female delinquents and their long skirts.
	[Scum]
	David: MY BLOOD BROTHER! WHY DID YOU NOT KNOW SAY THIS SOONER. LET'S GO WOZ! TO BECOME THE DELINQUENT KINGS!
	Woz: THE SCUM BROTHERS LINKED UP! I'LL BE THE VOICE OF REA-
	Jo: Delinquents make mad dosh by shaking up their underclassme-
	Woz: MY BLOOD BROTHERS! LET'S BECOME DELINQUENT KINGS!
	Teacher: Please... It's still the middle of the lesson... can't you go be delinquent kings outside...	
	
	[The three with crowns outside]
	David: I don't think the origami crowns are really helping, plus the girls are looking at us weird.
	Jo: We need to get into the right mindset, these origami crowns are part of the bigger picture, I tell you.
	Jo: See, this is why I am the captain of our Bosoball team, underling #2.
	David: I'M NOT EVEN UNDERLING #1?! AND WHO DIED AND MADE YOU KING??
	Woz: Underling #2 please be quiet, when we, your seniors are talking.
	David: DON'T GO ALONG WITH HIIIIIM!
	Jo: First we should test our Bosobilities, get your bikes and bats so we can hit some balls.
	David: I don't have a bike, we're too young to have a license.
	Woz: I don't have a bat, pets cost too much.
	Jo: I see this won't be easy...
	Jo: SO GENIUS ME PREPARED THIS, TADA, WITNESS PEGASUS AND EXCALIBUR!
	[Bike and tennis racket]
	David: ...
	David: ...
	David: *Honk Honk*
	David: A mighty steed.
	Woz: Get on Dave, I'll throw you some balls. 20 cents a piece, a steal.
	David: Uhhhh.
	
	[David hits balls]
	
	Jo: H- H- H- Home Runs?!
	David: *pffft*
	David: And you kept saying spending hours every day locked up in my room training my right arm would never pay up. Who's laughing now?
	Woz: Scum! An amazing Bosoball player but still scum!
	Jo:  "The left arm of the devil", just like in my Bosoball manga! Amazing, scum!
	David: When did we settle on scum, you bastards?
	
	
	Basil: Fufufufu, if it isn't the skeleton crew.
	David: Ugh, it's Basil.
	Underling: And me, his loyal underling wh-
	Jo: How long are you going to bully people just for being thin?
	Basil: Hmph, your anorexic brains could never understand the genius behind my body that is following the greek ideal.
	Woz: Grrr, he's right, but it's still annoying!
	David: Is this- Are you su- Umm, I don't wanna be body negative but-
	Jo: What do you want? Steal our lunch?
	Woz: I already took their lunch money, there is nothing to take!
	David: You did what?
	Basil: Fufufu, the Basil Information Network immediately caught wind of your little Bosoball scheme.
	Underling: Actually it was me who found out, I am-
	Basil: Skellys like you becoming the top delinquents of this town? Come back once you've gained a thousand pounds!
	Jo: I see, so as this school's banchou you want to put these two wannabe delinquents and me in our place by challenging us to Bosoball.
	David: ARE YOU REALLY ON OUR SIDE?!
	Woz: And you're betting your most precious possession as your ante (your bike)!
	Basil: My- my most precious possession?! (They want... my virginity?!)
	Jo: Dave will bet his too. Show him Dave.
	Basil: (Show? Are they "that"? First-years these days are different than I remember...)
	David: It's too big, I can't just show it off whenever I want to! I'll show him if he wins! 
	Basil: (Am I in danger?!)
	Basil: I DON'T WANT THAT! How abooouuut: If you lose you will never get to play Bosoball again and you will be my food serving slaves for the rest of your lives.
	Jo: NEVER BOSOBALL AGAIN?!
	DAVE: THAT'S WHAT SETS YOU OFF?!
	Woz: Deal. But Dave will also give you his most prized possession.
	Dave: ARE YOU REALLY ON OUR SIDE?!
	
	Ütz vs Basil + Underling #3
	
	Underling: WHY WAS I ONLY CREDITED AS UNDERLING #3! I HAVE A NAME, IT'S-
	Basil: You won this cook-off. Fair and square. On my fat honor I must accept that. You are the new top delinquents of this school.
	David: That was easier than I thou-
	Basil (undressed): Do with me as you wish~ <3
	David: ...
	Jo: ...
	Woz: ...
	Woz: So anyway, we won, so we'll take your bike now. You can, uhhh, "finish off" by your lonesome.
	Underling #3 (undressed): HEY!
	Dave: I'm just glad I keep to keep my porn stash.
	Basil: I see, it was a misunderstanding.
	Dave: Woah Woz, you're pretty good at this.
	Woz: My brother runs a bike shop, I sometimes help out for a small modest fee. I do well for myself, but my brother seems to be struggling [total siscon saying take it all].
	Dave: With this we got the bike we need to play Bosoball!
	Jo: And I just found this bat lying around!
	Underling #3: Hey! My bat!
	Jo: This is the beginning of our legend! To fame!
	Woz: To riches!
	Dave: To bitches!
	Basil: To all the best food in the world!
	Rest: ...
	Woz: It's fine as long as you pay the membership fee.
	Everyone: Eh?!
	[And so our three heroes gathered their first new team member and set out for the title of delinquent king. But this is where demo 2 ends, maybe they'll become true delinquents next time, or maybe some psychopath with a fascination of knives turns up, it could really go either way. Because everything is possible in the EXCITING world of]
